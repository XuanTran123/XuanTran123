### Project 1: Default Prediction from Lending Club Data
This project is a part of the course Data Science for Business 1 at Aalto University. The dataset was the loan data of Lending CLub downloaded from Kaggle, containing data that has already been cleaned. The goal of the project was to build different predictive models so as to predict whether a customer is likely to pay back the loan or not. Because the data was imbalanced, SMOTE method was applied to balance the data. However, the models are built from both original and balanced data.
