### Project 1: Default Prediction from Lending Club Data
This project is a part of the course Data Science for Business 1 at Aalto University. The dataset was the loan data of Lending CLub downloaded from Kaggle, containing data that has already been cleaned. The goal of the project was to build different predictive models so as to predict whether a customer is likely to pay back the loan or not. Because the data was imbalanced, SMOTE method was applied to balance the data. However, the models are built from both original and balanced data.

3 models were built: 2 Logistics Regression models( one with balanced and imbalanced data) and Decision Tree with balanced data. The precision, recall, accuracy and AUC scores, and expected benefits of 3 models are calculated. In summary, Logistic Regression with balanced data is chosen because it has highest expected benefit, highest AUC score and highest accuracy score.
